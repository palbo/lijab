A line oriented extensible jabber client.

Disclaimer
----------

This program carries a big Works For Meâ„¢ sign, and is tested in very little
configurations, so messages may be lost, misrouted, eaten, etc.

Use at your own risk! :-)


Features
--------

* Tab completion for most things.
* Shiny colors!
* Logging.
* Roster / subscriptions handling.
* Status / priority handling.
* Delivery and display of chat state notifications.
* Hooks (on_message_received, on_message_sent, et al).
* Fairly easy to make new commands in ruby.
* Command aliases


Requirements
------------

* GNU Readline (pretty sure libedit won't work right now).
* A very ansi-compatible terminal, color is probably a good idea.

### Gems
* xmpp4r
* file-tail
* term-ansicolor

### Debian/Ubuntu

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev rubygems1.8 libreadline-dev libopenssl-ruby


Installation
------------

    $ sudo gem install palbo-lijab -s http://gems.github.com

### Debian/Ubuntu

Also need to do
    
    $ sudo ln -s /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/lijab /usr/bin/lijab 

Or put the gems bin dir in your path (e.g. in your .bashrc)

    PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin

Go complain to them, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgems-ruby/+bug/145267


Known issues
------------

Usually reconnection works well-ish, but sometimes lijab doesn't realize the
connection died so you might have to restart the program.


Bugs
----

I make and unconscious effort to introduce bugs in all my programs, so people
have something to entertain themselves with.

Report bugs in http://palbo.github.com/lijab/issues, github pull request for patches.

Comments, bug reports and patches can also go to `quuxbaz@gmail.com`.
